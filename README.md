# Overview

Welcome to my analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analyst roles. This project was created out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to help find optimal job opportunities for data analysts.

The data sourced from [Luke Barousse's Python Course](https://lukebarousse.com/python) which provides a foundation for my analysis, containing detailed information on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills. Through a series of Python scripts, I explore key questions such as the most demanded skills, salary trends, and the intersection of demand and salary in data analytics.

# The Questions

Below are the questions I want to answer in my project:

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools I Used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** This was used to analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** I visualized the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

I start by importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset, followed by initial data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality.

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter India Jobs

To focus my analysis on the Indian job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'India']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)


for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)[::-1]
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')

plt.show()
```

<summary>ðŸ”‘ Cross-role Trends</summary>

- **SQL + Python are universal**: Both appear across all roles, but their weight changes:  
  - Analysts â†’ SQL-heavy  
  - Engineers â†’ SQL + Python balanced  
  - Scientists â†’ Python-dominant  
- **Visualization tools** (Excel, Tableau, Power BI) are **analyst-centric**, rarely emphasized for engineers or scientists.  
- **Cloud & big data tools** (AWS, Azure, Spark) are **engineer-centric**, reflecting the infrastructure-heavy nature of the role.  
- **Statistical tools** (R) remain relevant only for scientists, showing their focus on modeling and research-driven analysis.

<summary>ðŸ“Œ Role-specific Insights</summary>

**1. Data Analyst**  
- SQL (52%) is the backbone skill, with Python (36%) rising as a secondary requirement.  
- Excel (35%) remains surprisingly strong, showing that traditional tools still matter.  
- Visualization (Tableau 27%, Power BI 21%) is a **key differentiator** for analysts.  

**2. Data Engineer**  
- SQL (68%) and Python (61%) are nearly universal requirements.  
- Spark (38%) and cloud platforms (AWS 37%, Azure 36%) highlight the **pipeline + infrastructure focus**.  
- Engineers are expected to **build and scale**, not just analyze.  

**3. Data Scientist**  
- Python (70%) is the undisputed core skill â€” higher than for any other role.  
- SQL (48%) remains important but secondary.  
- R (33%) shows that **statistical modeling** still has a niche.
